## Notes

- This is a test application for demonstrating my code to **NordLocker**.
- GRPC server and models were provided to me by third party company, so **in the sake of privacy I removed them from the repo**.
- The production app should have used **Coordinator** pattern responsible for moving between screen as it's one of the Best iOS devleopment practices.
- Another Best practice is to inject dependencies with **Dependenty Injection** mechanism, so the classes may be tested more effectively with Unit tests.

* A preview **video to demontstrate** the working application: find **Credis Preview.mov** in the main folder
